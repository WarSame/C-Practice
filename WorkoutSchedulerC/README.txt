Workout Scheduler
In C, to be ported to Android
The proof of concept for an eventual app idea. 

This app will help you time and schedule your workouts, both in the individual workout, as well as acting as a calendar/scheduler.
It will offer options for each day with timeslots chosen, and a description text. This will include a repeating schedule option.

In the individual workout this app will function as a timer and workout outline. Given your workout schedule beforehand it will display your next excercise, as well as the amount and weight of the reps required. This can be edited on the fly to easily update your reps.
By giving your rest length, you will be able to hit a timer button when you are done to limit yourself to a given recovery time.
